          <h1>Doctoral Consortium</h1>
          <p>
            The ASSETS 2025 Doctoral Consortium (DC) is expected to be held on Sunday, October 26,
            2025, as an in-person event.
          </p>
          <p>
            The overarching goal of the consortium is to encourage and prepare a group of promising
            student researchers dedicated to accessibility and assistive technology by:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Providing PhD students with a supportive forum to submit and receive high-quality
              feedback about their accessibility-related dissertation work from researchers outside
              their own institution, including student peers, faculty, and industry professionals.
            </li>
            <li>
              Providing opportunities for participants to network with one another and with senior
              members of the ASSETS community.
            </li>
            <li>
              Enabling student participants to attend the ASSETS 2025 conference, to contribute to
              the conference goals through interaction with other researchers and conference events,
              and to learn of potential career paths within academia and industry.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <h2>Who Should Apply</h2>
          <p>
            We encourage early-to-mid stage doctoral candidates to apply rather than students who
            have already made substantial progress toward their dissertations. The DC focuses on
            earlier-stage students because the goal is to provide feedback that can help guide and
            shape dissertation research agendas.
          </p>
          <p>
            Applicants may also submit to the Student Research Competition, but the work described
            must be different.
          </p>

          <h2>Relevant Topics</h2>
          <p>
            Relevant topics for the Consortium are the same as for the conference. Read the
            <a href="./call_for_papers.html">call for papers</a>.
