          <h1>About Sponsorship</h1>
          <p>
            ASSETS 2025 is the leading conference in the research and design of accessible
            technology for people with disabilities and older adults. It will be held Oct 26–29,
            2025 in Denver, Colorado, USA. There will also be a virtual component for people who
            cannot physically attend. The organizing committee is led this year by Dr. Shaun Kane of
            Google and Dr. Kristen Shinohara from the Rochester Institute of Technology of
            Rochester, NY, USA and includes top international scholars in the field.
          </p>
          <p>
            Our conference community is composed of scholars, educators, and students in computing
            technology and accessibility. Roughly half of our attendees are undergraduate, MS, or
            PhD students. The conference will include research talks, poster and demo presentations,
            a doctoral consortium, and community-building events such as accessible cultural
            activities and a reception. Based on attendance in prior years, we anticipate 200-250
            attendees.
          </p>
