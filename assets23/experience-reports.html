                    <p>Research on accessible and assistive technologies is primarily motivated by the needs of people with disabilities and
                    other stakeholders, like caregivers and educators. Understanding these needs is crucial, but often requires first-hand
                    experience that might be unavailable to all researchers in the community. ASSETS 2023 invites submissions that reflect
                    peopleâ€™s experiences with disabilities and the challenges and opportunities related to accessible and assistive
                    technologies. These reports will be reflective in nature and will give authors an opportunity to share their experiences
                    as people with disabilities, caregivers, rehabilitation professionals, educators, researchers, developers,
                    entrepreneurs, or other stakeholders.</p>
                    
                    <p>Experience reports should clearly explain how the research community will benefit from the reported experience. This
                    year submissions can be structured in a variety of ways (see <a href="#submission-guidelines">submission guidelines</a> below). When applicable, the
                    technology and the focus of the report should be described, including the citation of appropriate references. Potential
                    topics include but are not limited to:
                    <ul>
                    <li>accessibility challenges or solutions in existing technology;</li>
                    <li>every-day problems for which effective assistive technologies do not yet exist;</li>
                    <li>challenges in accessing technologies due to costs, cultural aspects, etc.;</li>
                    <li>needs of specific communities, such as people with multiple disabilities;</li>
                    <li>age-specific needs, such as children with disabilities;</li>
                    <li>challenges or solutions in the development and distribution of accessible and assistive technologies;</li>
                    <li>challenges or solutions related to regulatory policies;</li>
                    <li>challenges or solutions arising in the field of accessibility and computing education;</li>
                    <li>good practices possibly not yet supported by appropriate technologies;</li>
                    <li>challenges or solutions during rehabilitation processes;</li>
                    <li>limitations or benefits of tools and methodologies in the field of education of people with disabilities or specific learning disorders;</li>
                    new trends in practices and habits.</ul></p>
                    
                    Please note, unless explicitly advised by the technical paper review panel, authors should not submit papers that were
                    not accepted to the technical paper track for review within the experience report track.

                    <p>Experience Reports proposals should be submitted using one of the templates found on the <a href="submission-templates.html">Submission Templates</a> page.This
                    year, we are <strong> only </strong> accepting <strong>position papers</strong> (e.g., <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/1878803.1878807" target="_blank">https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/1878803.1878807</a>) and <strong> case studies </strong>
                    (e.g., <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3441852.3476468" target="_blank">https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3441852.3476468</a>). <strong> No other types of submissions will be accepted </strong>. This is because
                    Experience Reports are managed by the Technical Program Chairs and the Posters and Demos chairs. </p>
                    
                    <p>Experience Reports proposals are limited in length to <strong>8 pages</strong> in the single-column submission format and references do
                    not count toward page limits. Submissions are NOT double-anonymized: the authors' names should be on the paper. </p>
                    
                    All submissions will be peer-reviewed by an international panel, per the ASSETS policy on Program Committees. <a href="http://www.sigaccess.org/welcome-to-sigaccess/resources/accessible-writing-guide/">Writing
                    Guidelines</a> are available to help authors choose appropriate language for writing about technology and people with
                    disabilities. Finally, please refer to the <a href="https://www.acm.org/publications/policies/plagiarism-overview">ACM policy on plagiarism</a> for guidance.
                    
                    <p>Accepted Experience Reports will be published in the conference proceedings. Your PDF file must be accessible. Please

                    <h4>IMPORTANT - Author PCS Account Details</h4>
                    ACM continues to update the publication process and now paper metadata will be pulled directly from your personal PCS
                    account. This means that it is crucial for you and all of your co-authors to update the contact information so that
                    names, affiliations AND primary email addresses are stylized exactly in the way that you all would want to see them in
                    the ACM digital library and on your paper. For example, if you use a personal email address (xyz123@hotmail.com) as your
                    primary contact email in PCS then this email will appear on your paper. Please <a href="https://new.precisionconference.com/user/login?next=https%3A//new.precisionconference.com/contact_info" target="_blank">check your author information and make
                    necessary changes</a>.
