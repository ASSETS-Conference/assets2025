          <h1>Updates</h1>
          <h2>Chairs Update: March 2025</h2>
          <p>
            Hello ASSETS community! This blog from your general chairs,
            <a href="https://www.kristenshinohara.com/" target="_blank">Kristen</a> and
            <a href="https://shaunkane.com/" target="_blank">Shaun</a>, to provide insight into how
            the planning process is going and to provide more transparency into how ASSETS
            functions.
          </p>
          <h3>Maintaining our Values of Diversity and Community</h3>
          <p>
            It’s an unusual year for a variety of reasons, and we understand there are a lot of
            questions and a lot of uncertainty. We hope to maintain a dialog with the ASSETS
            community to communicate the issues that are top of mind for us and the Organizing
            Committee, and to be transparent about decisions we make regarding the conference in
            this wild year.
          </p>
          <p>
            First, it’s worth acknowledging the challenging times we find ourselves in and we
            understand the future is unknown and very scary for many. We also acknowledge and affirm
            our values, which we shared with you when we announced ASSETS 2025 at the closing of
            last year’s conference: we value diversity and innovation, toward building a strong
            community of researchers who share a passion and drive for accessibility research that
            changes the world. Our mission in leading ASSETS 2025 is to strengthen community through
            a welcoming and thought-provoking conference that encourages discussion on challenging
            topics and inspires groundbreaking research. Simply and in no uncertain terms, we value
            diversity and community, and we strive to create a welcoming conference.
          </p>
          <h3>Adapting to Change</h3>
          <p>
            With these changes in mind, we share some of the decisions and discussions we’re having
            around building an inclusive conference and supporting our community. On the conference
            planning side, uncertainty that affects conference attendees also affects our
            projections for attendance and costs.
          </p>
          <h4>Clarifying the ASSETS ‘25 Hybrid Experience</h4>
          <p>
            For many reasons, we know that in-person travel to Denver, CO for ASSETS 2025 may be
            affected by current events. Understanding that we do not know how this will impact
            conference attendance come October, we must remind ourselves of that the main goal of
            the conference to share research and engage with one another. We also know that the
            conference policies that we set affect decisions that you may be making around
            submitting to the conference and attending the conference.
          </p>
          <p>
            Items that factor into our thinking include the cost for in-person spaces, for
            audio/visual infrastructure for online participation, and for accessibility support - a
            non-negotiable mainstay of our conference. Many of these factors depend on your
            participation and attendance (registration) to support, therefore, it is difficult for
            us to determine many specifics until we know how many will attend and how they will
            participate. As an example, our contract with the conference hotel obligates us to a
            minimum food and beverage budget. If so few people attend in person then we risk not
            meeting that minimum, and we are obligated to fulfill the balance. These considerations
            could affect how we coordinate the in-person experiences and set presentation
            expectations for the conference.
          </p>
          <p>
            With that in mind, we are making decisions about the conference as early as we can,
            while accounting for the uncertainty of the current moment. Specifically relating to
            hybrid, it will be our policy that all accepted papers will appear in the conference
            proceedings, regardless of presentation and attendance modality. Keeping in mind that
            conference costs are high and expected to increase, at least one author for each
            published paper will be expected to register at the in-person / presenter rate. We
            intend to release more details on registration rates soon. We are keeping some options
            open about when and how virtual presentations will happen, but we do not want you to
            worry about papers getting pulled due to travel limitations.
          </p>
          <p>
            We will also be adding some questions as part of the submission process in PCS, for
            authors to communicate whether they are likely or unlikely to present in person. These
            are not binding questions, and will not be made available to reviewers, but are intended
            to improve our estimates of in-person and hybrid attendance only.
