            <h3>Getting to the venue</h3>
            <p>
              Free shuttle buses run approximately every 10 minutes from <strong>Denver Union Station.</strong>
              The stop is located just outside the station, straight out from the end of the train tracks.
              Take the shuttle and get off at <strong>Curtis Street.</strong> From there, the venue is two blocks to
              your right and should take around 15 minutes in total to reach.
            </p>
            <p>
              If you prefer to walk, follow 16th Street until you reach 16th and Curtis. From there,
              continue two blocks down Curtis Street to your right. The Curtis Hotel will be ahead.
              Walking takes about 20 minutes.
            </p>
            <p>
              You can also take a rideshare or taxi directly to The Curtis Hotel.
            </p>
            <p>
              Please note that not all traffic lights in the area have audible signals.
            </p>

            <h3>At the venue</h3>
            <p>
              The event will take place on the 2nd and 3rd floors of The Curtis Hotel.
            </p>
            <p>
              Elevators are available directly from the main entrance. Those nearest the lobby have a
              single “up” button, while the elevators further inside have two buttons. All elevator
              buttons include Braille labels. There are pillars close to some of the elevators on the
              conference floors so be careful when stepping out.
            </p>
            <p>
              On the conference floors, directional signs will be available to help you find your
              sessions. As the area is somewhat spread out, please don’t hesitate to ask a Student
              Volunteer for assistance if needed. Be aware that the lobby, elevators, and event
              spaces are somewhat narrow.
            </p>
            <p>
              If you’re staying at The Curtis Hotel, captioning devices are available at the front desk
              for your check-in.

              (A copy of this information is also available at

            </p>
            <p>
              This year ASSETS will be fully hybrid. There are two key components to this year's set
              up: a Zoom livestream for synchronous interaction during the technical program and the
              ASSETS 2025 Discord server for asynchronous interaction.
            </p>

            <p>
              All podium presentations (e.g., paper talks, keynote, business meeting) will be
              livestreamed on Zoom. The recordings will be posted after the session on Discord. For
              posters and demos, online interaction will be asynchronous. Posters will be uploaded
              as accessible PDFs, alongside a text-based version, onto Discord as a thread under the
              poster channel. Attendees and authors are encouraged to interact with online attendees
              within these threads.
            </p>

            <p>
              Links to the posters and papers will be in Discord channels according to their session
              (e.g., more information about a poster being presented on Monday can be found in
              ⁠monday-posters, the video for a paper being presented in Session 1B is linked in the
              channel ⁠1b-movement). We will also have channels on Discord that keep track of which
              sessions are happening live in Denver as well as places for online attendees to ask
              questions and connect.
            </p>

            <p>
              We have guidelines for both in-person and remote participants to ensure a smooth and
              accessible hybrid experience.
            </p>

              We’re happy to announce the social activities that we will offer in the evenings at
              ASSETS 2025. Our committee has worked hard to provide a number of diverse activities
              to enhance the ASSETS 2025 experience.
            </p>

            <p>
              On Monday evening, we’ll host a conference reception at the
              <a href="https://www.dmns.org/">Denver Museum of Nature and Science.</a> This
              reception will have appetizers and drinks available and include access to some of the
              museum’s exhibits. Buses will transport attendees from The Curtis Hotel to the museum
              on Monday evening after the last session; details will follow closer to the event.
            </p>

            <p>
              On Tuesday evening, following the ACM SIGACCESS Business Meeting, Google will host the
              conference reception at The Curtis Hotel. This reception will also have appetizers and
              drinks.
            </p>

            <p>
              Also on Tuesday evening, we are excited to welcome
              <a href="https://www.feelthebeat.dance/">Feel the Beat</a>, a Colorado-based dance
              studio dedicated to accessible dance and music education. They will offer three
              classes for ASSETS attendees at The Curtis Hotel. Space is limited and will be
              available first come, first served. Sign up information will be shared during the
              conference.

            <p>
              We’re overwhelmed by the response to ASSETS 2025 and are happy to report that we’ve
              reached our registration goals and beyond; this will be the largest ASSETS yet! We
              must limit new in-person registrations. We are working on ways to create more space.
              However, if spots open up due to cancellations, we are happy to take new
              registrations. Virtual registrations are still open. Please see our responses to
              individual questions below:
            </p>

            <ul>
              <li>
                <strong>How was the registration cap determined?</strong> We are limited by the
                square footage and seating restrictions of the ballrooms we’re using at The Curtis
                and by the physical spaces in and around the conference area in the hotel.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Registered, but no longer planning to attend in person?</strong> If your
                plans have changed and you are not traveling to Denver, please contact the
                <a href="mailto:treasurer-assets25@acm.org">Registration Chair</a> as soon as
                possible to let us know your change in plans. While we are now past the cancellation
                deadline and cannot process refunds, we can convert your registration type to
                Virtual, which will enable us to open a slot for in-person registrations and ensure
                you have access to our online content.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Do you still need to register?</strong>
                <a href="https://web.cvent.com/event/2197df01-92d8-4c44-8ac6-4de540b0d61f/"
                  >Virtual registration</a
                >
                is still available! For in-person registrations, given the limited space and
                possibility for cancellations, we will open slots if and when they become available.
                This process will allow us to accept registrations on a first come, first served,
                waitlist basis. Sign up for the
                <a href="https://forms.gle/5xpQ29BvhwBDRYem8">wait list here</a> and we will reach
                out to you when a seat opens. Registrations will be accepted in order entries are
                received.

              We are pleased to announce that the
              <a href="./schedule.html">ASSETS 2025 program</a> is now available on the ASSETS
              website! This year will include the largest technical program in ASSETS history,
              comprising 83 technical papers, 82 posters and demos, 8 experience reports, 7 TACCESS
              journal presentations, 5 workshops, and 5 student research competition (SRC)
              presentations. The content in this year’s program is an impressive representation of
              cutting-edge research in areas such as generative AI, augmented and virtual reality,
              communication and collaboration, and fairness, accountability, transparency and
              ethics. Due to the size of this year’s program, we had to make some scheduling
              decisions that will result in an ASSETS program that differs from prior years.
            </p>

            <p>
              ASSETS 2025 will be fully dual track, except for the opening and closing plenaries,
              the keynote, and the SRC session. We intentionally did not schedule another session
              during the SRC presentations to give attendees the opportunity to support, encourage,
              and provide feedback to the presenters. We understand that a dual track ASSETS will
              not allow attendees to experience the full technical program, which has been possible
              in years past. But our community is growing rapidly, and to maintain sessions that
              will allow for meaningful presentation lengths and opportunities for audience
              engagement, we believe a dual track program is the best choice. This year will be an
              opportunity for all of us to reflect on how we want to engage and participate at
              ASSETS conferences moving forward.
            </p>

            <p>
              We would like to thank the authors for their amazing contributions, and all the
              reviewers, student volunteers, and program and organizing committee members for their
              time, energy, effort, and commitment to the ASSETS community.

              83 technical papers will be showcased at this year’s conference. Congratulations to

            <p>
              Our community continues to grow and push the boundaries of an engaging accessible
              hybrid conference experience. ASSETS 2024 set the bar for a great online experience
              for remote and in-person attendees. It is our goal to meet these expectations to the
              best of our ability for ASSETS 2025. However, meeting this goal requires more
              technical, audio/visual, and accessibility infrastructure than required in past years.
              For instance, each session incorporates a contracted AV set up with multiple cameras
              to capture the presenter, ASL interpreter, captions, and attendees’ video for Q&A. The
              set up also includes streaming content presented and captions, and requires human
              labor (both AV contractors, Hybrid Chairs, and student volunteers) to ensure smooth
              transitions throughout and between sessions. All these costs doubled when we added a
              dual track. Past conferences absorbed this cost through fees as low as 15% of the
              in-person rates, with minimal support or limited streaming.
            </p>

            <p>
              While conference expenses have grown and essentially doubled for a dual track program,
              fees have not kept up. Going into ASSETS 2025, we adjusted our budgetary expenses to
              match our experiential expectations (hybrid streaming and multiple tracks), but that
              means raising both in-person and virtual registration rates in order to be able to
              support the extra infrastructure and effort. Our past registration rates can not
              sustain conference activities at the quality and scale we have moved to. As always, we
              have prioritized keeping the conference affordable to all attendees, and especially to
              students and ACM members, who continue to have access to reduced rates.
            </p>

            <p>
              We understand financial and economic circumstances may make it challenging to travel
              and attend the conference. By making these changes, we aim to create a more
              sustainable funding model for ASSETS so that we can maintain the same levels of
              quality and accessibility.

            </h2>

            <p>
              A quick update from the Doctoral Consortium organisers! We have been contacted by a
              number of people regarding the DC, and our intention of offering a hybrid event, given
              the current challenges with travel, as well as the intention to support remote
              participation of the conference at large.
            </p>
            <p>
              We very much appreciate the contact we have received and indeed, we have been
              discussing this amongst ourselves and the wider ASSETS organising committee. Without
              being able to detail specifics, it is our current intention to offer remote
              participation in the DC. We are as yet unsure of the exact nature of the remote
              offering, and are currently working through it.
            </p>
            <p>
              We encourage all eligible PhD candidates to consider applying for the ASSETS DC,
              regardless of current capacity to travel to the conference. We will provide more
              information about the exact nature of the remote offering as those details get worked
              out.

              Indicating Presentation Modality in PCS
              <span class="blog-post-date">April 10, 2025</span>
            </h2>

            <p>
              <a href="https://new.precisionconference.com/submissions" target="_blank"
                >Precision Conference</a
              >
              is now open, and we are excited to receive your work! You may notice an additional
              question in the submission form about presentation modality, and wanted to share our
              thought processes here and how it will impact the conference.
            </p>

            <p>
              tl;dr: Planning ASSETS 2025 has required us to make many decisions based on estimates
              of attendance. Since current events impact travel, we are asking for more information
              this year to give us a more accurate estimate of attendance, but are doing so in a way
              that will not impact the review process.
            </p>

            <h3>The Cost of Conference Organizing</h3>

            <p>
              Organizing any major event is an exercise in future problem solving. Plans for ASSETS
              2025 began in early 2024, including decisions about where and when the conference
              would be held. Suffice it to say that this planning includes making decisions that
              directly affect the conference budget, such as where the conference will be located
              and the expected in-person and hybrid attendance. To coordinate the in-person aspects
              of the conference requires reserving a space (usually a hotel conference center),
              which entails making commitments to how many rooms the hotel will hold for attendees
              and how much money will be spent at the hotel on food. Specifically, to secure the
              space for this conference we committed to the hotel that a minimum number of hotel
              rooms would be booked by attendees, and that we will purchase at least a certain
              amount of food.
            </p>
            <p>
              Accessibility support is a mainstay of our conference, and we have also set aside
              budgeting for ASL interpreters, CART, and consideration for complementary registration
              for personal assistants as needed. These items are non-negotiable as far as our
              expenses are concerned but are sizeable, and adds additional costs that are not
              necessarily incurred by other conferences of our size (even if we think they should
              be).
            </p>

            <p>
              Further, in recent years there have been increasing requests for maintaining and
              expanding the hybrid experience for ASSETS. In this category we are truly standing on
              the shoulders of giants, in that the ASSETS 2024 committee did an amazing job of
              creating a compelling hybrid experience. We have committed to meeting this level of
              hybrid experience, which itself adds some costs in terms of additional AV setup. This
              is compounded by the shift to having two parallel tracks for the technical program,
              which means we need to organize and pay for AV infrastructure twice over.
            </p>

            <p>
              When brainstorming what we wanted this conference to be, we committed to an accessible
              physical space and an integrated and accessible hybrid space. Thus, decisions were
              made in 2024 in line with these expectations.
            </p>

            <p>
              We note that while these are our core expenses, the conference also incurs other
              costs, including but not limited to: the fee for Precision Conference (PCS) for paper
              submissions and reviewing, the cost for Cvent -- the system used to register
              attendees, and the cost for publishing the proceedings with ACM (i.e. using APTARA to
              prepare the proceedings).
            </p>
            <h3>The Challenges of Traveling in 2025</h3>
            <p>
              We understand the realities of the present moment means that some attendees will need
              to reconsider their travel plans. In 2024, ASSETS attendees participated from 24
              countries, and nearly 20% of participants attended online. Past conference virtual
              fees could be as low as 15% the in-person cost, which required that in-person fees
              subsidized the cost for hybrid support. Using that cost structure, the conference
              requires a minimum of in-person attendees to be able to support virtual attendance.
              While we have worked to restructure our budget to avoid this dependency as much as
              possible, in-person registration remains closely tied to our ability to support key
              conference activities. During the past few weeks, we have heard from many of you in
              the ASSETS community about how the current environment may impact travel plans to
              attend ASSETS this year. But the plural of anecdote is not data, so we are hoping to
              gather more information as part of the paper submission process, so that we can make
              better educated decisions on costs and planning moving forward.
            </p>

            <h3>What Has Changed</h3>
            <p>When submitting your paper in PCS, you will see the following question:</p>
            <p>
              <em>Indicate intent to attend ASSETS in-person or virtually</em>
            </p>
            <p>
              <em
                >ASSETS 2025 is offering a hybrid program, and is aiming to plan ahead to better
                serve attendees. Indicate your answer to the following question using the given
                scale: At this time, if this paper is accepted, which of the following most closely
                represents this paper’s authors’ plans to present the paper: Note: The answer to
                this question will not be shared with paper reviewers and will only be viewable by
                the technical program chairs and the general chairs. Your answer is nonbinding; we
                understand that plans change. This question is being asked for planning purposes
                only.
              </em>
            </p>

            <ul>
              <li><em>At least 1 presenting author plans to attend ASSETS in person.</em></li>
              <li>
                <em
                  >At least 1 presenting author plans to attend ASSETS in person, but they may not
                  be able to.</em
                >
              </li>
              <li>
                <em>It is highly likely that none of the authors will attend ASSETS in person.</em>
              </li>
              <li><em>None of the authors plan to attend ASSETS in person.</em></li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Why This Change</h3>
            <p>
              As noted above, our estimates assume a minimum number of in-person attendees to meet
              expenses for the cost of the hotel, food, and accessibility infrastructure (at the
              very least). If attendance is lower than expected, that can negatively impact the
              conference experience and result in overspending our limited budget. On the positive
              side, the sooner that we can identify potential changes in expected attendance, the
              more flexibility we have to make adjustments.
            </p>

            <p>
              We have already made some adjustments to the conference experience using the
              information that we have, such as adjusting the hybrid registration rates to cover
              more of our expenses—more on that in a later blog post. But, as mentioned above,
              depending on in-person attendance numbers, these fees may not offset potential gaps in
              the budget.
            </p>

            <p>
              Therefore, to help us estimate future attendance and the associated costs-and in order
              to try our best to ensure the conference is financially viable-we are gathering as
              much data as possible when we can. To that end, we’ve asked for some information from
              submitters about their plans to attend the conference, whether in-person or virtually.
              Gathering this information will help us to make decisions on how much on-site AV
              infrastructure is needed, how many tracks (and therefore, how many rooms and ASL
              interpreters and CART providers) are needed, and how much food to order, etc.
              Ultimately, it helps us to prepare as much as we can to ensure a successful conference
              experience no matter how you attend.
            </p>
            <h3>Confidentiality and Anonymity</h3>
            <p>
              We understand that some may hesitate to share their attendance plans. Only the
              Technical Program Chairs (TPCs) and General Chairs (GCs) will have access to your
              responses, and we will only examine them in the aggregate. Our main goal is to try to
              anticipate how many people may attend in person, and how many may attend virtually.
              Reviewers will not have access to this information. TPCs and GCs will not have access
              to individual conflicted papers.
            </p>

            <p>
              As always, we appreciate all of the members of our community and hope you will
              participate in ASSETS this year in whatever capacity you are able to. Good luck with
              your submissions!

            </h2>
            <p>
              Hello ASSETS community! This blog from your general chairs,
              <a href="https://www.kristenshinohara.com/" target="_blank">Kristen</a> and
              <a href="https://shaunkane.com/" target="_blank">Shaun</a>, to provide insight into
              how the planning process is going and to provide more transparency into how ASSETS
              functions.
            </p>
            <h3>Maintaining our Values of Diversity and Community</h3>
            <p>
              It’s an unusual year for a variety of reasons, and we understand there are a lot of
              questions and a lot of uncertainty. We hope to maintain a dialog with the ASSETS
              community to communicate the issues that are top of mind for us and the Organizing
              Committee, and to be transparent about decisions we make regarding the conference in
              this wild year.
            </p>
            <p>
              First, it’s worth acknowledging the challenging times we find ourselves in and we
              understand the future is unknown and very scary for many. We also acknowledge and
              affirm our values, which we shared with you when we announced ASSETS 2025 at the
              closing of last year’s conference: we value diversity and innovation, toward building
              a strong community of researchers who share a passion and drive for accessibility
              research that changes the world. Our mission in leading ASSETS 2025 is to strengthen
              community through a welcoming and thought-provoking conference that encourages
              discussion on challenging topics and inspires groundbreaking research. Simply and in
              no uncertain terms, we value diversity and community, and we strive to create a
              welcoming conference.
            </p>
            <h3>Adapting to Change</h3>
            <p>
              With these changes in mind, we share some of the decisions and discussions we’re
              having around building an inclusive conference and supporting our community. On the
              conference planning side, uncertainty that affects conference attendees also affects
              our projections for attendance and costs.
            </p>
            <h4>Clarifying the ASSETS ‘25 Hybrid Experience</h4>
            <p>
              For many reasons, we know that in-person travel to Denver, CO for ASSETS 2025 may be
              affected by current events. Understanding that we do not know how this will impact
              conference attendance come October, we must remind ourselves of that the main goal of
              the conference to share research and engage with one another. We also know that the
              conference policies that we set affect decisions that you may be making around
              submitting to the conference and attending the conference.
            </p>
            <p>
              Items that factor into our thinking include the cost for in-person spaces, for
              audio/visual infrastructure for online participation, and for accessibility support -
              a non-negotiable mainstay of our conference. Many of these factors depend on your
              participation and attendance (registration) to support, therefore, it is difficult for
              us to determine many specifics until we know how many will attend and how they will
              participate. As an example, our contract with the conference hotel obligates us to a
              minimum food and beverage budget. If so few people attend in person then we risk not
              meeting that minimum, and we are obligated to fulfill the balance. These
              considerations could affect how we coordinate the in-person experiences and set
              presentation expectations for the conference.
            </p>
            <p>
              With that in mind, we are making decisions about the conference as early as we can,
              while accounting for the uncertainty of the current moment. Specifically relating to
              hybrid, it will be our policy that all accepted papers will appear in the conference
              proceedings, regardless of presentation and attendance modality. Keeping in mind that
              conference costs are high and expected to increase, at least one author for each
              published paper will be expected to register at the in-person / presenter rate. We
              intend to release more details on registration rates soon. We are keeping some options
              open about when and how virtual presentations will happen, but we do not want you to
              worry about papers getting pulled due to travel limitations.
            </p>
            <p>
              We will also be adding some questions as part of the submission process in PCS, for
              authors to communicate whether they are likely or unlikely to present in person. These
              are not binding questions, and will not be made available to reviewers, but are
              intended to improve our estimates of in-person and hybrid attendance only.
