          <h2>Creating Accessible PDFs</h2>
          <p>
            ACM publications are read (and reviewed) by many people. Making your paper accessible
            will help to promote the equal participation of people with disabilities in science and
            engineering. This note describes how to check if your PDF is accessible, and how to fix
            the most common accessibility problems. For more information please refer to
            <a href="http://www.adobe.com/accessibility/resources.html" target="_blank"
              >Adobe's accessibility resource center</a
            >.
          </p>

          <h3>How do I test if my PDF is accessible?</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>
              The document should be tagged. In Adobe Acrobat Pro: Go to the 'File' menu. 'Document
              properties'. 'Description' tab. Look for 'Tagged PDF: Yes' among the set of advanced
              properties. If you do not have access to Adobe Acrobat, try selecting some text in the
              PDF and pasting it into a text editor. If you can't do this, or the text looks wrong,
              chances are your document is not readable with a screen reader.
            </li>
            <li>
              Check the accessibility. In Adobe Acrobat Pro: Go to the 'Advanced' menu.
              'Accessibility'. 'Full Check'. The checker will report accessibility problems.
            </li>
            <li>
              Fonts should be embedded, or your PDF will need to be regenerated, and you may lose
              accessibility that you have added. In Adobe Acrobat Pro: Go to the 'File' menu.
              'Document properties'. 'Fonts 'tab. All of the fonts should have the word 'embedded'
              in parentheses after the font name (unless they are not visible in the final document)
            </li>
          </ul>

          <h3>How do I fix accessibility problems?</h3>
          <p>
            Word users should correct as many problems as possible in the Word source file rather
            than the pdf, as described in the next section. On a PC, the Adobe plugin for Word can
            export accessibility features from the Word document into the pdf.
          </p>
          <p>
            On a Mac, this is not the case. Those using Word on a Mac, and all LaTeX users will need
            to edit the PDF directly using Adobe Acrobat. A better basic PDF may be produced by
            using latex2pdf as opposed to ps2pdf. See also the

            The accessibility checker in Adobe Acrobat Pro provides help with fixing many
            accessibility problems. The following steps are for Adobe Acrobat Pro 9. More detailed

          <ul>
            <li>
              Add tags. Go to the 'Advanced' menu. Select 'Accessibility', then 'Add tags to
              document'.
            </li>
            <li>
              Add alternative text for figures. Context-click the Figure, select 'Properties', and
              fill in 'Alternate Text'. If no 'Properties' option appears, go to the 'Advanced'
              menu, select 'Touch Up Reading Order', and then try context-clicking on the figures
              again, looking for an 'Edit alternate text' option.
            </li>
            <li>
              Specify the document language. Go to the 'File' menu. Select 'Properties', then the
              'Advanced' tab, 'Language' field. In some versions of Acrobat, the 'Properties' option
              is called 'Document Properties'. In some versions the 'Language' field is in a
              'Reading Options' tab.
            </li>
            <li>
              Define tab order.
              <ul>
                <li>Go to the 'View' menu. Select 'Navigation tabs', then 'Pages'.</li>
                <li>
                  Click on any page, then type Ctrl-A (or Command-A on a Mac) to select all the
                  pages.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Go to the 'Options' menu in the top right of the dialog box (icon showing two
                  cogs), and select 'Page Properties'.
                </li>
                <li>In the 'Tab Order' tab, select 'Use document structure'.</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
              Make sure tables have headings.
              <ul>
                <li>Go to the 'View' menu. Select 'Navigation tabs', then 'Tags'.</li>
                <li>Select the 'Tags' tab. This panel shows the document structure as a tree.</li>
                <li>Navigate to the table cells that should be headers.</li>
                <li>
                  Check they have the type &lt;th&gt; . If not, then right click on the header cell,
                  select 'properties', select the 'Tag' tab, and change the value for 'Type' to
                  'Table Header Cell'. &lt;/th&gt;
                </li>
              </ul>
            </li>
          </ul>

          <h3>Creating an accessible PDF directly from Word</h3>
          <p>
            The following link provides step-by-step instructions for adding basic accessibility
            information to a Word document on a PC, then exporting it to a PDF document intended for
            ACM:
            <a
              href="http://www.sigaccess.org/welcome-to-sigaccess/resources/acm-submission-with-ms-word/"
              target="_blank"
              >Create an accessible ACM submission using Microsoft Word</a
            >.
          </p>

          <h3>Making Accessible Figures and Tables</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Do not add your figures as a pdf. The tagging of figures that are in pdf can sometimes
              lead to undesired effects on the visual presentation. Instead, insert the image, for
              example, as png or svg.
            </li>
            <li>Do not add your tables as images.</li>
            <li>
              Give your tables lines/borders. This can facilitate the tagging of the document.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <h2>Video Presentation Creation Guidelines</h2>
          <p>
            Video presentations, like papers, must be accessible. For videos to be accessible, they
            require an audio narration (so that a person with a visual impairment can understand the
            contents of the video) and text captions (so that a person who is deaf or hard of
            hearing can understand the video’s contents). Since accessibility is a top priority in
            our community, we may ask you to fix your video if it is not fully accessible. So,
            please follow these guidelines carefully, ask questions if you have them, and make
            accessibility a priority.
          </p>
          <p>
            To assist you with creating an accessible video presentation, we have developed the
            following guidelines:
          </p>

          <h3>Steps for creating video presentation and closed-captioning:</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Please DO NOT burn the captioning text directly into your video presentation. You will
              upload the video and closed-captioning files separately.
            </li>
            <li>Make sure to describe important visuals.</li>
            <li>
              Manually modify closed-captioning content to match video and audio and to verify
              correct transcription.
            </li>
            <li>Try to keep your reading speed under 180 words per minute.</li>
          </ul>

          <h3>Guidelines for creating your presentation video:</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Create your presentation video with audio using your favorite program (Adobe Premiere
              Pro, Zoom, PowerPoint, etc.).
            </li>
            <li>Video resolution: 1920 x 1080px</li>
            <li>Video format: MP4</li>
          </ul>
          <h3>Guidelines for accessible narrations:</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Your narrations should be able to stand on their own. Try listening to your video
              without looking at it. If everything makes sense, you are on the right track.
            </li>
            <li>
              Narrations should describe visuals including pictures, visualizations (graphs, etc),
              tables, and diagrams. Describe the important trends or most salient features of these
              visuals.
            </li>
            <li>
              Avoid statements like, “As you can see here…” instead say, “This slide shows
              [described visual].”
            </li>
            <li>Make sure you read or closely paraphrase any text that appears in the video.</li>
          </ul>
          <h3>Guidelines for closed-captioning:</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Font: A sans serif font (e.g., Arial, Helvetica, Verdana)</li>
            <li>Font Color: White</li>
            <li>Font Background: Black background box</li>
            <li>Line Length: No more than ~40 characters</li>
            <li>Number of Lines: No more than two (2) lines</li>
            <li>Line Alignment: Centre</li>
            <li>Positioning: Lower center of the video presentation screen</li>
            <li>Export captions format: SRT</li>
            <li>Try to keep your subtitles on the screen for at least two (2) seconds.</li>
            <li>
              Keep the bottom ~1/5 of the video screen free of important visuals. This keeps images
              from being covered over by the subtitles.
            </li>
            <li>
              Captions should coincide with your audio soundtrack. If you have significant pauses,
              please add in ellipses (…).
            </li>
            <li>
              If splitting your subtitles into two (2) lines, keep the lines at an equal or similar
              length.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <h2>Making Accessible Presentations</h2>
          <p>
            Presenters are responsible for making their presentations accessible to the diverse
            attendees at the conference. For instance, there will be ASL interpreters during the
            conference for people who use sign language, and there will be attendees in the audience
            who are blind or who have low vision.
          </p>
          <p>
            As a resource to our community, Kyle Rector has prepared a wonderful and concise guide
            about how to make your presentation accessible, along with a video
