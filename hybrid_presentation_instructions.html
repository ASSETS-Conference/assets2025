          <h1>Hybrid Presentation Instructions</h1>

          <p>
            This year ASSETS will be fully hybrid. There are two key components to this year's set
            up: a Zoom livestream for synchronous interaction during the technical program and the
            ASSETS 2025 Discord server for asynchronous interaction.
          </p>

          <p>
            All podium presentations (e.g., paper talks, keynote, business meeting) will be
            livestreamed on Zoom. The recordings will be posted after the session on Discord. For
            posters and demos, online interaction will be asynchronous. Posters will be uploaded as
            accessible PDFs, alongside a text-based version, onto Discord as a thread under the
            poster channel. Attendees and authors are encouraged to interact with online attendees
            within these threads.
          </p>

          <p>
            Links to the posters and papers will be in Discord channels according to their session
            (e.g., more information about a poster being presented on Monday can be found in
            ⁠monday-posters, the video for a paper being presented in Session 1B is linked in the
            channel ⁠1b-movement). We will also have channels on Discord that keep track of which
            sessions are happening live in Denver as well as places for online attendees to ask
            questions and connect.
          </p>

          <p>
            We have guidelines for both in-person and remote participants to ensure a smooth and
            accessible hybrid experience.
          </p>
