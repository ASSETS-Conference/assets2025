          <h1>Call for Papers</h1>
          <p>
            The <strong>ASSETS</strong> conference is the premier forum for presenting research on
            the design, evaluation, use, and education related to computing for people with
            disabilities and older adults. We invite high-quality original submissions on topics
            relevant to computing and&nbsp;accessibility.
          </p>
          <p>
            Submissions should present significant contributions to design, systems, tools,
            scientific understanding, methodology, or social issues. Relevant topics include (but
            are not limited to) new enabling technologies, studies of how technologies are used by
            people with disabilities, explorations of barriers to access, and evaluations of
            accessibility education methods. We recommend that papers with a technical contribution
            be validated through research activities with representative users when possible.
            However, we acknowledge that many accessibility-focused projects may begin with deep
            formative work with representative users, or may be based on prior research with
            representative users, and as such key contributions of a single paper may be primarily
            technical.
          </p>
          <p>
            All Technical Papers and Posters and Demonstrations submissions are peer-reviewed by an
            international Program Committee. Accepted papers and the abstracts for posters and
            demonstrations, experience reports, and the student research competition will be
            archived in the ACM Digital Library. At least one author of accepted submissions must
            register as the presenter by the early registration deadline.
          </p>
