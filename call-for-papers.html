          <h1>Call for Papers</h1>
          <p>
            The <strong>ASSETS</strong> conference is the premier forum for presenting research on
            the design, evaluation, use, and education related to computing for people with
            disabilities and older adults. We invite high-quality original submissions on topics
            relevant to computing and&nbsp;accessibility.
          </p>
          <p>
            Submissions should present significant contributions to design, systems, tools,
            scientific understanding, methodology, or social issues. Relevant topics include (but
            are not limited to) new enabling technologies, studies of how technologies are used by
            people with disabilities, explorations of barriers to access, and evaluations of
            accessibility education methods. We recommend that papers with a technical contribution
            be validated through research activities with representative users when possible.
            However, we acknowledge that many accessibility-focused projects may begin with deep
            formative work with representative users, or may be based on prior research with
            representative users, and as such key contributions of a single paper may be primarily
            technical.
          </p>
          <p>
            All Technical Papers and Posters and Demonstrations submissions are peer-reviewed by an
            international Program Committee. Accepted papers and the abstracts for posters and
            demonstrations, experience reports, and the student research competition will be
            archived in the ACM Digital Library. At least one author of accepted submissions must
            register as the presenter by the early registration deadline.
          </p>

          <h2>Important Dates <span class="sub-menu">Technical Papers</span></h2>
          <p>All deadlines are 11:59 P.M. Anywhere on Earth (UTC -12:00).</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Wednesday, April 16, 2025 – submission deadline</li>
            <li>Wednesday, May 28, 2025– initial reviews sent to authors, rebuttal phase opens</li>
            <li>Wednesday, June 4, 2025 – rebuttal phase closes</li>
            <li>Wednesday, June 18, 2025 – acceptance decisions sent to authors</li>
            <li>Wednesday, July 16, 2025 - camera-ready deadline</li>

          </ul>
          <p>
            Technical papers are expected to present significant and original contributions. For
            early work and work-in-progress, authors may consider submitting a poster or demo.
            Papers may expand upon previously published posters or demos, but must present novel and
            significantly extended content, and should cite any previous abstracts for posters or
            demos. Please refer to the ACM policy on plagiarism for guidance.
          </p>
          <h2>Submission Guidelines</h2>
          <h3>Paper Format and Length</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>
              ASSETS uses the
              <a
                href="https://authors.acm.org/proceedings/production-information/taps-production-workflow"
                target="_blank"
                >ACM Publication System (TAPS) process</a
              >
              to generate final multi-format representations of accepted papers.
            </li>
            <li>
              The correct template for submission is: single-column
              <a
                href="https://authors.acm.org/proceedings/production-information/preparing-your-article-with-microsoft-word"
                target="_blank"
                >Word Submission Template</a
              >
              and single-column
              <a
                href="https://authors.acm.org/proceedings/production-information/preparing-your-article-with-latex"
                target="_blank"
                >LaTeX</a
              >
              (using “manuscript” style available in the template). You may also choose to use
              <a
                href="https://authors.acm.org/proceedings/production-information/overleaf"
                target="_blank"
                >Overleaf</a
              >.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            The length of most accepted technical papers will be 7,500 to 10,000 words (4,000 to
            5,000 for short technical papers); note that references do not count towards these word
            counts. A good rule of thumb is that the length of your paper should be commensurate
            with its contribution.
          </p>
          <h3>Accessible Submissions</h3>
          <p>
            Your PDF submission must be accessible. It may take several hours to make your PDF file
            accessible (adding alt tags, etc.), so be sure to leave time before the submission
            deadline to do so. Please refer to the instructions on creating an accessible ACM
            conference paper information on how to accomplish this.
          </p>
          <p>
            It is expected that papers will be made accessible both at the time of review and for
            the final submission.
            <strong>Paper submissions that are not accessible will be desk rejected.</strong> If you
            have questions about making your paper accessible, please contact the Accessibility
            Chairs at <a href="mailto:access-assets25@acm.org">access-assets25@acm.org</a>.
          </p>
          <h3>Optional Accessible Video Figures as Supplementary Material</h3>
          <p>
            You may include an optional video figure to accompany your paper submission as
            supplementary material, which may be up to <strong>five minutes</strong> long. There is
            a separate upload field on the PrecisionConference submission website. Video figures are
            strongly encouraged for papers that introduce a novel system or interaction technique.
            Video figures are not the same as video presentations of accepted papers shown during
            the conference.
          </p>
          <p>
            Video figures should be in .mp4 format and should be less than 50 MB. Like papers, video
            figures must be accessible. For videos to be accessible, include both audio narration
            (so that the contents of the video can be understood by someone who is blind or low
            vision) as well as text captions (so that the video can be understood by someone who is
            deaf or hard of hearing). Text captions can be burned directly into the video as
            subtitles (preferred), or closed-captioning metadata files (*.srt, *.ttml, *.vtt) can be
            uploaded as additional supplementary material. Please refer to the guidance on
            accessible video figures.
          </p>
          <h3>Anonymous Submissions</h3>
          <p>
            ASSETS will utilize a fully anonymous review process for Technical Papers.
            <strong
              >Authors must anonymize their paper submissions, all supplemental materials, and video
              figures.</strong
            >
            All author names, affiliations, and contact information should be removed. You should
            not anonymize references to your prior work (these are needed as part of the review
            process). Instead, you should refer to all prior work in the third person. While it may
            not be possible to remove all clues to who the authors are, we expect authors to do
            their best. Authors with difficulty applying this anonymization policy to their research
            are encouraged to contact the technical program chairs for additional guidance.
          </p>
          <p>
            Supplemental video figures should be anonymized for review (i.e., do not include author
            or institution names in videos).
          </p>
          <p>
            Although submissions are anonymous, please ensure that you and your co-authors obtain an
            ORCID ID so you can complete the publishing process for your accepted paper.
          </p>
          <h3>Review Process</h3>
          Submissions that do not meet formatting or accessibility guidelines, are not properly
          anonymized, are out of the topical scope of the conference, or are otherwise deemed
          non-competitive by the program chairs may be rejected without review. Otherwise,
          submissions will be peer-reviewed by an international panel.

          <p>
            Authors with sufficiently high review scores will have an opportunity to submit a
            “Rebuttal” after receiving the reviews, prior to the final acceptance decisions. The
            window of time for this rebuttal period is about a week, so authors should plan
            accordingly. Read the important dates section above.
          </p>
          <p>
            Accepted papers will be presented at the ASSETS 2025 conference. More details about the
            presentation will be released closer to the conference.
          </p>
          <p>
            Submissions MUST contain substantial original, unpublished material. Please refer to the
            <a href="https://www.acm.org/publications/policies/plagiarism-overview" target="_blank"
              >ACM policy on plagiarism</a
            >.
            <a
              href="http://www.sigaccess.org/welcome-to-sigaccess/resources/accessible-writing-guide/"
              target="_blank"
              >Writing Guidelines</a
            >
            are available to help authors choose appropriate language for writing about technology
            and people with disabilities.
          </p>
          <h3>Short vs. Long Papers</h3>
          <p>
            Short papers are meant to capture more focused, concise research contributions compared
            to full papers. Short papers, like full papers, are rigorously peer-reviewed, archival
            publications. Short papers are not works-in-progress, incomplete work, etc.
            (Works-in-progress should be submitted to the Posters and Demos track).
          </p>
          <p>
            Short paper submissions use the same template as full-length technical papers but should
            be limited to 4,000 to 5,000 words, not including references. Accepted short papers will
            appear in the main conference proceedings, and will be orally presented at the
            conference. Short papers must adhere to the same anonymity and accessibility standards
            as full papers, and may also include accompanying video figures (read previous section
            on Optional Accessible Video Figures as Supplementary Material), particularly if they
            introduce a novel system or interaction technique.
          </p>
          <h3>How to submit</h3>
          <p>
            The submission deadline is Wednesday, April 16, 2025, 11:59 P.M. Anywhere on Earth (UTC
            -12:00). Please submit via the
            <a href="https://new.precisionconference.com/assets" target="_blank"
              >ASSETS 2025 technical papers submission site</a
            >.
          </p>
          <h3>Author PCS Account Details</h3>
          <p>
            ACM continues to update the publication process. Currently, paper metadata will be
            pulled directly from your personal PCS account. This means that it is crucial for you
            and all of your co-authors to update the contact information so that names,
            affiliations, AND primary email addresses are stylized exactly in the way that you all
            would want to see them in the ACM digital library and on your paper. For example, if you
            use a personal email address (xyz123@hotmail.com) as your primary contact email in PCS
            then this email will appear on your paper. Please check your author information and make
            the necessary changes.
          </p>
          <h3>Publishing with ACM Digital Library</h3>
          <p>
            The official publication date is when the proceedings are made available in the ACM
            Digital Library. This date may be up to two weeks prior to the first day of your
            conference. The official publication date affects the deadline for any patent filings
            related to published work. (For those rare conferences whose proceedings are published
            in the ACM Digital Library after the conference is over, the official publication date
            remains the first day of the conference.)
          </p>
          <h2>Further Information</h2>
          <p>
            By submitting your article to an ACM Publication, you are hereby acknowledging that you
            and your co-authors are subject to all ACM Publications Policies, including ACM's new
            Publications Policy on Research Involving Human Participants and Subjects. Alleged
            violations of this policy or any ACM Publications Policy will be investigated by the ACM
            and may result in a full retraction of your paper, in addition to other potential
            penalties, as per ACM Publications Policy.
          </p>
          <p>
