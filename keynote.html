          <h3>Keynote: Accessibility in the Age of Agentic AI</h3>          
          <p> Over the past few years, AI has shifted from tools to teammates: multimodal, personalized, and increasingly agentic. This talk opens the door to what’s working now for accessibility in AI (captions, descriptions, assistive agents), current limitations (bias, hallucinations, evaluation), and what the next three years demand from our community - datasets that reflect disability, safety and governance aligned to EAA/AI Act, and research that includes disabled people in the loop. We’ll share Microsoft case studies, open tools, and concrete calls-to-action for ASSETS researchers.
