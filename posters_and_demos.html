          <h1>Posters and Demonstrations</h1>
          <p>
            The Poster and Demonstration Track is an opportunity to present late-breaking results,
            ongoing research projects, and speculative or innovative work in progress. This session
            is an ideal platform for researchers and practitioners to present their work, engage in
            discussion regarding their work, and receive valuable feedback. Participants are invited
            to submit high-quality posters and demonstrations presenting novel ideas, designs,
            techniques, systems, tools, evaluations, scientific investigations, methodologies,
            social issues or policy issues relating to any topics that may interest the
            accessibility community. A poster is a great way to test new ideas, generate interest in
            a research area, or describe useful or interesting work that is not substantial enough
            for a full paper presentation. A demonstration is a great way to communicate inventive
            accessible computing and IT technologies in action.
          </p>
          <p>
            The submission must clearly demonstrate relevance to accessibility research. Decisions
            about acceptance will be based on relevance to accessibility, originality, potential
            significance, topicality, and clarity. A detailed list of suggested topics can be found
            in the Call for Papers.
          </p>

            limits. As a part of the submission for demonstrations, a video is optional, but highly
            encouraged to showcase the proposed idea/concept.

          </p>

          <p>
            We will use a fully anonymous review process for Posters and Demos. Authors must
            anonymize their paper submissions and all supplemental materials. All submissions will
            be peer-reviewed by an international panel, per the ASSETS policy on Program Committees.
          </p>
          <p>Accepted submissions will be included in the conference proceedings.</p>

          <h2>Accessible Submissions</h2>

          <p>
            Your PDF submission must be accessible. It may take several hours to make your PDF file
            accessible (adding alt tags, etc.), so be sure to leave time before the submission
            deadline to do so. Please refer to the
            <a
              href="https://www.sigaccess.org/welcome-to-sigaccess/resources/accessible-pdf-author-guide/"
              target="_blank"
              >instructions on creating an accessible ACM conference paper information</a
            >
            on how to accomplish this.
          </p>

          <p>
            It is expected that posters and demonstrations will be made accessible both at the time
            of review and for the final submission.
            <strong>Submissions that are not accessible will be desk rejected.</strong> If you have
            questions about making your workshop or demonstration submission accessible, please
            contact the Accessibility Chairs at
            <a href="mailto:access-assets25@acm.org">access-assets25@acm.org</a>.
          </p>

          <h2>How to Submit</h2>
          <p>
            The submission deadline is Wednesday, June 25, 2025, 11:59 P.M. Anywhere on Earth (UTC
            -12:00). Please submit your posters and demonstrations via the
            <a href="https://new.precisionconference.com/assets" target="_blank"

          <h3>Important-Author PCS Account Requirements</h3>
          <p>
            ACM continues to update the publication process. Currently, paper metadata will be
            pulled directly from your personal PCS account. This means that it is crucial for you
            and all of your co-authors to update the contact information so that names,
            affiliations, AND primary email addresses are stylized precisely in the way that you all
            would want to see them in the ACM digital library and on your paper. For example, if you
            use a personal email address (xyz123@hotmail.com) as your primary contact email in PCS
            then this email will appear on your paper. Please check your author information and make
            the necessary changes.
          </p>

          <h2>Authorship Guidelines</h2>
          <p>
            The ACM Publications Board has recently updated the ACM Authorship Policy in several
            ways:
          </p>

          <ul>
            <li>Addressing the use of generative AI systems in the publications process</li>
            <li>Clarifying criteria for authorship and the responsibilities of authors</li>
            <li>Defining prohibited behavior, such as gift, ghost, or purchased authorship</li>
            <li>
              Providing a linked FAQ explaining the rationale for the policy and providing
              additional details
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Please read the updated policy at
            <a
              href="https://www.acm.org/publications/policies/new-acm-policy-on-authorship"
              target="_blank"
              >https://www.acm.org/publications/policies/new-acm-policy-on-authorship</a
            >
            and ensure your submission adheres to it.
          </p>

          <h2>Further Information</h2>
          <p>
            By submitting your article to an ACM Publication, you are hereby acknowledging that you
            and your co-authors are subject to all ACM Publications Policies, including ACM's new
            Publications Policy on Research Involving Human Participants and Subjects. Alleged
            violations of this policy or any ACM Publications Policy will be investigated by ACM and
            may result in a full retraction of your paper, in addition to other potential penalties,
            as per ACM Publications Policy.
          </p>

          <p>
            Please ensure that you and your co-authors obtain an ORCID ID, so you can complete the
            publishing process for your accepted paper. ACM has been involved in ORCID from the
            start and we have recently made a commitment to collect ORCID IDs from all of our
            published authors. We are committed to improving author discoverability, ensuring proper
            attribution and contributing to ongoing community efforts around name normalization;
            your ORCID ID will help in these efforts.
          </p>
