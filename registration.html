          <h2>Overview</h2>
          <p>
            Registrations for conferences can be complicated, reflecting an array of options and
            time-contingent fee structures. ASSETS is no different. Allow us to help make sense of
            things. We have:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Four registration types:
              <ul>
                <li>(1) ACM member</li>
                <li>(2) non-member</li>
                <li>(3) student ACM member</li>
                <li>(4) student non-member</li>
              </ul>
              If you are not yet an ACM member, it often makes financial sense to become one before
              registering.
              <a href="https://www.acm.org/membership/membership-options"
                >See ACM's membership options here</a
              >. Three registration deadlines that affect pricing: (1) early, (2) regular, (3) late.
              Generally, it's best to register early to save costs and to help us plan events.
            </li>
            <li>
              Two conference experiences: (1) the in-person conference in Denver, Colorado, or (2) a
              virtual attendance option. Full details of both experiences will be published as they
              become available.
            </li>
            <li>
              Two workshop experiences: (1) in-person workshop will take place the Sunday before the
              conference in Denver, Colorado, and (2) virtual workshops will take place in the week
              before the conference online. See individual
              <a href="accepted_workshops.html">Workshop details</a> for more information on how to
              participate in workshops. Below, we expand on each option and provide pricing. There
              is also information about guest reception tickets, registration for personal
              assistants, and accessibility support.
            </li>
          </ul>

            Below, we expand on each option and provide pricing. There is also information about
            guest reception tickets, registration for personal assistants, and accessibility
            support.
          </p>
          <br />

          <h2>In Person Conference</h2>
          <p>
            ASSETS’25 is planned primarily as an in-person event with a virtual attendance option
            for which we are still working out the details.
          </p>

          <p>
            We are planning a vibrant in-person conference experience with an exciting technical
            program, ample opportunities for networking, hands-on demos, and evening social events.
          </p>

          <p>
            Sessions in the main conference hall will be interpreted into ASL and captioned by CART
            providers. If you are bringing a personal assistant with you for accessibility support,
            please email the treasurer at treasurer-assets25@acm.org to learn how to register them.
          </p>

          <p>
            At least one author of each accepted submission is expected to register for the full
            in-person conference by the early registration deadline, whether they attend the
            conference in person or virtually.
          </p>

          <p>
            The registration form will offer the opportunity for you to purchase extra reception
            tickets for guests. If they would like to attend any additional conference activities,
            they must complete their own conference registration form.
          </p>

          <br />

          <h2>Cost Explainer</h2>
          <p><b>The general chairs provide some background into how registration is priced in the <a href="updates.html">blog</a></b></p>
          <p>
            ASSETS continues to grow with this year’s paper submissions growing growing 20% over
            2024. Our technical paper submission rate has more than doubled in the last three years
            (132 submissions in 2022 to 279 this year), it follows that this year’s program of 83
            technical papers doubles the program we had in 2022.
