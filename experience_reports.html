          <h1>Experience Reports</h1>

          <p>
            Research on accessible and assistive technologies is primarily motivated by the needs of
            people with disabilities and other stakeholders. Understanding these needs is crucial
            but often requires first-hand experience that might be unavailable to all researchers in
            the community. ASSETS 2025 invites Experience Report track submissions that reflect
            people’s experiences with disabilities and the challenges and opportunities related to
            accessible and assistive technologies. These reports will be reflective in nature and
            will give authors an opportunity to share their experiences as people with disabilities,
            caregivers, rehabilitation professionals, educators, researchers, developers,
            entrepreneurs, or other stakeholders.
          </p>

          <p>
            Experience report submissions should clearly explain how the research community will
            benefit from the reported experience. When applicable, the focus of the report should be
            described, including the citation of appropriate references. Potential topics include
            but are not limited to:
          </p>

          <ul>
            <li>Accessibility challenges or solutions with existing technology;</li>
            <li>Everyday problems for which effective assistive technologies do not yet exist;</li>
            <li>Barriers to accessing technologies due to costs, cultural aspects, etc.;</li>
            <li>
              Challenges or solutions in the development and distribution of accessible and
              assistive technologies;
            </li>
            <li>Recommendations for technologies which leverage best practices;</li>
            <li>
              Requirements of specific communities, such as people with multiple disabilities,
              children with disabilities, or older adults;
            </li>
            <li>
              Challenges or solutions related to conducting research in an accessible and equitable
              manner;
            </li>
            <li>Challenges or solutions related to regulatory policies;</li>
            <li>
              Challenges or solutions arising in the field of accessibility and computing education;
            </li>
            <li>
              Challenges or solutions of tools and methodologies in the field of education of people
              with disabilities;
            </li>
            <li>Other topics relevant to the ASSETS conference</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            We encourage authors to not be constrained by the technical paper format, and offer
            authors the chance to submit their work in the form of a pictorial.
          </p>

          <p>
            We have curated a few examples of past experience reports that fit within the scope of
            the track:

          <p>Experience reports are not:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Personal accounts written under pressure. Although experience reports are an
              appropriate track for people to consensually share personal experiences, it is not a
              track for senior mentors to pressure students with disabilities and/or other
              minoritized identities to share experiences they do not want to share.
            </li>
            <li>
              Works in progress. If the work you are considering submitting would qualify for the
              posters and demos track, please submit it there. The experience reports track is meant
              to bring out knowledge that is not highlighted by other tracks. We understand the line
              can be thin; for example, someone sharing reflections on conducting a particular type
              of research study in an accessible manner may also publish a case study or technical
              paper reporting an evaluation of their accessible study design. Similarly, reflexive
              thematic analysis and other techniques recognize the researcher’s positionality in a
              similar way that experience reports are meant to foreground lived experience. However,
              reviewers will evaluate submissions according to how they uniquely fit within the
              experience reports track.

            >
            are available to help authors choose appropriate language for writing about technology
            and people with disabilities. Particularly for Experience Reports, when discussing their
            own experiences of disability, authors are encouraged to use their preferred language to
            describe their disability identity.
          </p>
          <p>
            All submissions will be peer-reviewed by an international panel, per the ASSETS policy
            on Program Committees.
          </p>
          <p>Accepted Experience Reports will be published in the conference proceedings.</p>

          <h2>Accessible Submissions</h2>
          <p>
            Your PDF submission must be accessible. It may take several hours to make your PDF file
            accessible (adding alt tags, etc.), so be sure to leave time before the submission
            deadline to do so. Please refer to the
            <a
              href="https://www.sigaccess.org/welcome-to-sigaccess/resources/accessible-pdf-author-guide/"

            on how to accomplish this.
          </p>

          <p>
            It is expected that experience reports will be made accessible both at the time of
            review and for the final submission.
            <strong>Submissions that are not accessible will be desk rejected.</strong> If you have
            questions about making your workshop or demonstration submission accessible, please

          <ul>
            <li>Addressing the use of generative AI systems in the publications process</li>
            <li>Clarifying criteria for authorship and the responsibilities of authors</li>
            <li>Defining prohibited behavior, such as gift, ghost, or purchased authorship</li>
            <li>
              Providing a linked FAQ explaining the rationale for the policy and providing
              additional details
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Please read the updated policy at
            <a
              href="https://www.acm.org/publications/policies/new-acm-policy-on-authorship"

              >https://www.acm.org/publications/policies/new-acm-policy-on-authorship</a
            >
            and ensure your submission adheres to it.
          </p>

          <h2>How to Submit</h2>
          <p>
            The submission deadline is Wednesday, June 11, 2025, 11:59 P.M. Anywhere on Earth (UTC

          <h3>Important-Author PCS Account Requirements</h3>
          <p>
            ACM continues to update the publication process. Currently, paper metadata will be
            pulled directly from your personal PCS account. This means that it is crucial for you
            and all of your co-authors to update the contact information so that names,
            affiliations, AND primary email addresses are stylized precisely in the way that you all
            would want to see them in the ACM digital library and on your paper. For example, if you
            use a personal email address (xyz123@hotmail.com) as your primary contact email in PCS
            then this email will appear on your paper. Please check your author information and make
            the necessary changes.
          </p>

          <h2>Further Information</h2>
          <p>
            By submitting your article to an ACM Publication, you are hereby acknowledging that you
            and your co-authors are subject to all ACM Publications Policies, including ACM's new
            Publications Policy on Research Involving Human Participants and Subjects. Alleged
            violations of this policy or any ACM Publications Policy will be investigated by ACM and
            may result in a full retraction of your paper, in addition to other potential penalties,
            as per ACM Publications Policy.
          </p>

          <p>
            Please ensure that you and your co-authors obtain an ORCID ID, so you can complete the
            publishing process for your accepted paper. ACM has been involved in ORCID from the
            start and we have recently made a commitment to collect ORCID IDs from all of our
            published authors. We are committed to improving author discoverability, ensuring proper
            attribution and contributing to ongoing community efforts around name normalization;
            your ORCID ID will help in these efforts.
          </p>
