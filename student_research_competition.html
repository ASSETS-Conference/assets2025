          <h2>How the Student Research Competition Will Work</h2>

          <p>
            The ACM Student Research Competition (SRC) is open to undergraduate and graduate
            students. At the conference, the authors will present their poster to a panel of experts
            and those who qualify for the next round will present their research to the conference
            audience. All accepted SRC submissions will be published in the conference proceedings,
            and the best presentations will receive a prize. The SRC is a fantastic opportunity to
            be introduced to the community and establish networks with fellow scientists.
          </p>

          <h2>Testimonials</h2>
          <p class="quote">
            “...What really caught my eye was how the community fosters growth and how the
            competition encourages us to learn the methodology behind other projects to improve our
            own.”

          <h2>Eligibility</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Participants must be enrolled (at the time of submission) at a university or college
              and have an active ACM student membership. If you are not a member yet, you can
              <a href="https://www.acm.org/membership/membership-options" target="_blank"
                >join the ACM</a
              >
              by paying a US $19 fee per year.
            </li>
            <li>
              Only individual research is accepted from Graduate (MS or PhD program) students; group
              research projects will not be considered. If an individual is part of a group research
              project and wants to participate in an SRC, they can only present their part of the
              research.
            </li>
            <li>
              Team projects are acceptable at the undergraduate level. All team members should be
              undergraduate students. One team member should be designated by the team to attend the
              conference and make the oral presentation.
            </li>
            <li>Note that supervisors/advisors are not allowed to be co-authors.</li>
            <li>
              Students may only participate in one ACM SRC per program year (July 1-June 30).
              Students who have applied to an SRC, but have not been accepted, may respond to other
              SRC calls for participation during the program year.
            </li>
            <li>
              Work accepted as a full paper for one of the technical sessions of the conference
              cannot also be considered for the Student Research Competition. Students having a
              technical paper, however, are encouraged to submit separate work to the Student
              Research Competition.
            </li>
            <li>
              The same topic of work cannot be presented at more than one of the conference venues
              (SRC, DC, or as a regular technical paper).
            </li>
            <li>
              SRC submissions should not be under review at other conferences or similar venues.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <h2>Submissions</h2>
          <h3>For whom?</h3>
          <p>
            The ACM Student Research Competition (SRC) is an event open to undergraduate and
            graduate students.
          </p>
          <h3>What needs to be submitted?</h3>
          <p>
            Students wishing to participate submit abstracts of their work. Qualifying research must
            deal with topics that are relevant to the mission of the ASSETS conference, as described
            by the Call for Papers. Preference will be given to work that has been completed (or is
            close to completion).
          </p>

          <p>
            Submissions have a 4,000 to 5,000-word limit using templates that can be found on the
            Submission Templates page. Note that references do not count toward page limits.
          </p>

          <p>
            Successful entries will be published in the ASSETS 2025 proceedings and the ACM Digital
            Library. Submissions (in PDF format) should be submitted by the deadline: June 25, 2025,
            at 11:59 P.M. Anywhere on Earth (UTC -12:00). It is important to note that these are NOT
            anonymous submissions; the authors' names should be on the paper.
          </p>

          <p>
            In addition, after acceptance, authors will be required to prepare a short audio speech
            file describing the content of their posters. This feature makes posters more accessible
            to blind and low-vision attendees. More details on this will be available in due course.
          </p>

          <p>
            Your PDF file must be accessible. Please refer to the instructions on
            <a
              href="https://www.sigaccess.org/welcome-to-sigaccess/resources/accessible-pdf-author-guide/"

              >Creating an Accessible ACM Conference Paper</a
            >
            for information on how to accomplish this. If you cannot create an accessible PDF at
            submission time then you will be given the option to upload either an accessible HTML or
            Microsoft Word version of your paper in addition to your PDF to facilitate review. If
            your paper is accepted, the final version will need to be transformed into an accessible
            PDF document.

          </p>

          <h2>Participating in the SRC</h2>
          <p>
            Once SRC submissions are reviewed, accepted projects will be invited to present at
            ASSETS 2025.
          </p>

          <p>At the conference, there will be two rounds of competition:</p>

          <h3>First Round Competition</h3>
          <p>
            Participants will present a poster to a panel of judges. After the judges have reviewed
            the posters and discussed the research with each participant, a group of semi-finalists
            for each category (undergraduate and graduate) will be selected to present at the second
            round of the competition.
          </p>

          <h3>Second Round Competition</h3>
          <p>
            Semi-finalists will then give an oral presentation on their work as part of a main
            conference session. A panel of judges will evaluate their knowledge of the research
            area, their contribution to the field, and the quality of the presentation.
          </p>

          <p>
            Three winners will be chosen in each category, undergraduate and graduate, receiving
            their medals (gold, silver, and bronze) and a monetary prize of US$500, US$300, and
            US$200, respectively sponsored by ACM. First-place winners will be designated as
            finalists and advance to the SRC Grand Finals. Participants should plan to stay through
            the ASSETS conference as the awards ceremony will take place during the closing session.
          </p>

          <p>
            Note: Upon request, American Sign Language interpreters will be provided for
            participants in the SRC, both during the competition itself and for the remainder of the
            ASSETS conference. Requests for an interpreter must be indicated on the conference
            registration form when registering for ASSETS.
          </p>

          <h3>Advancing to the SRC Grand Finals</h3>
          <p>
            First-place undergraduate and graduate student winners from the ACM SRCs held throughout
            the year advance to the SRC Grand Finals. A panel of judges will evaluate the entries
            through an online competition. Three undergraduate and three graduate students from all
            ACM conferences will be designated the SRC Grand Finals winners from this competition.
          </p>
