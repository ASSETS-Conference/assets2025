          <h1>Workshops Proposals</h1>
          <p>
            We invite you to submit a proposal for workshops at ASSETS 2025. Workshops will bring
            together attendees with shared interests to meet in the context of a focused and
            interactive discussion. ASSETS workshops should include topics relevant to the ASSETS
            community, including design, systems, tools, scientific understanding, methodology, or
            social issues relevant to and including people with disabilities or older adults.
            Workshops may also focus on enabling technologies, technology use by people with
            disabilities, disability justice, legal and policy issues, or accessibility in computing
            education. Each workshop should generate ideas that will suggest promising directions
            for future work for the ASSETS community. If you are working in an emerging area of
            accessibility, please consider organizing a workshop.
          </p>

          <h2>Workshop Format</h2>
          <p>
            ASSETS 2025 workshops will be hosted either online or on-site at the conference hotel in
            Denver, Colorado. We have a limited number of half-day slots for on-site workshops, and
            the available rooms have limited capacity. Workshop submissions should specify whether
            the organizers strongly prefer to host the workshop on-site, and justify how the on-site
            component would uniquely benefit the workshop. The site of accepted workshops (either
            on-site or virtual) will be decided at the discretion of the Workshop Chairs; workshop
            organizers will be notified whether their workshop will be hosted on-site or virtually
            in their workshop acceptance notification. Because of space limitations, each workshop
            submission specifying a preference to be held on-site needs to be adaptable to a virtual
            format, in case there is no space to host it on-site.
          </p>

          <p>
            For on-site workshops, each room can accommodate approximately 40 people. While we
            expect on-site workshop attendees to participate in person, organizers may choose to
            accept online attendees (i.e., host a hybrid event). Please keep in mind, however, that
            this will require additional logistical work, and organizers will need to handle the
            setup and management of hybrid components. If workshop organizers already know that a
            majority of attendees will be participating remotely, or if the topic of the workshop is
            better suited to an online format (e.g., a large number of participants, or the need to
            accommodate time zones significantly different from the ASSETS in-person conference time
            zone), we encourage organizers to opt for the online format.
          </p>

          <p>
            For both online and on-site events, the level of accessibility support the conference
            can provide would be one interpreter team and one captioner per event (though this
            number may be adjusted).
          </p>

          <p>
            Please see the Suggestions sections for more details on how you might plan your
            workshop.
          </p>

          </ul>

          <p>
            This proposal is the only document from the workshop that will be included in the ASSETS
            Extended Abstracts proceedings. Any position paper or other material submitted by
            workshop participants is not included but may be distributed through avenues like the
            workshop website. The workshop organizers may also consider submitting an actionable
            summary or ‘lessons learned’-style report after the workshop to the SIGACCESS
            newsletter.
          </p>

          <h2>Accessible Submissions</h2>

          <p>
            Your PDF submission must be accessible. It may take several hours to make your PDF file
            accessible (adding alt tags, etc.), so be sure to leave time before the submission
            deadline to do so. Please refer to the
            <a
              href="https://www.sigaccess.org/welcome-to-sigaccess/resources/accessible-pdf-author-guide/"
              target="_blank"
              >instructions on creating an accessible ACM conference paper information</a
            >
            on how to accomplish this.
          </p>

          <p>
            Workshop proposals are expected to be made accessible both at the time of review and for
            the final submission.
            <strong>Submissions that are not accessible could be desk rejected.</strong> If you have
            questions about making your workshop proposal accessible, please contact the Workshop
            Chairs, Kotaro Hara and Annuska Zolyomi, at workshops-assets25@acm.org.
          </p>

          <h2>Suggestions for planning your inclusive workshop</h2>
          <p>
            On-site workshops may be scheduled for a half day and they must occur on Sunday, October
            26, 2025.
          </p>

          <p>
            The schedule for virtual workshops is more flexible and should be hosted between Monday,
            October 20 and Sunday, October 26, 2025 to allow for accessibility support. To help
            reduce videoconferencing exhaustion and to broaden participation for online events, we
            encourage organizers to think creatively and inclusively on how to make their workshops
            interactive. Workshop organizers may consider supporting offline activities ahead
            of/during the workshop (such as sending design kits to participants). Organizers may
            also want to consider tasks and activity design where attendees might be co-located
            (e.g., a workshop that connects multiple research groups) and could physically work
            together prior to joining the online workshop event.
          </p>

          <p>
            We expect to have participants from all around the world. As such, if you are planning
            an online workshop, it is vital that you plan your workshop to accommodate participants
            joining from a number of timezones. Consider more asynchronous breakout activities that
            participants can do on their own, complemented with shorter synchronous interactions
            where participants get together and discuss.
          </p>

          <h2>Workshop Selection Process</h2>
          <p>
            The ASSETS Workshop track will follow a peer review process. During the period between
            submissions and notifications, researchers and practitioners in the areas of
            accessibility, disability, and computing will be invited to review and discuss workshop
            proposal submissions on PCS.
          </p>
          <p>
            After the discussion period, the final selection will be curated by the workshop chairs
            based on the following assessment criteria:
          </p>

          <ul>
            <li>
              Does the workshop foster community-building and look to broaden diversity in the
              ASSETS community?
            </li>
            <li>Alignment of the workshop topic with the interests of the ASSETS community.</li>
            <li>
              The workshops’ potential to generate discussion on new directions of future work by
              the ASSETS community.
            </li>
            <li>
              Level of engagement and proposed interactivity in the workshop. For workshop proposals
              of comparable quality, preference will be given to workshops containing discussion,
              interactive sessions, and a diverse organization team.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            Based on the reviews and the discussion, the workshop chairs will make final decisions.
          </p>

          <h2>
            Responsibility of Workshop Organizers: Upon Acceptance of Workshop Proposals and Before
            the Workshop Day
          </h2>
          <p>
            Workshop organizers upon receiving notification of acceptance, must prepare to fulfill
            the following responsibilities prior to the workshop day:
          </p>

          <ul>
            <li>
              Set up a website: Organizers of an accepted workshop must set up and maintain a
              website with information about their workshop (deadlines, CfP, program, templates,
              accepted papers/participants, organizers, etc.). We will include the link to the
              workshop’s page on the official ASSETS workshop site.
            </li>
            <li>
              Advertise your workshop: Share your call for participants within your professional
              network. Accepted workshops will also be listed on the ASSETS’25 web page.
            </li>

            <li>
              Collect position papers or workshop artifacts: From potential participants (depending
              on how the organizers run the workshop). A position paper can be a 2-4 pages document.
              An artifact can be a video or images of physical objects that outlines the submitter’s
              view on the workshop theme and the reasons for the submitter’s interest in the topic.
            </li>
            <li>
              Set up a review process: Select participants accordingly. We expect workshops to
              target a minimum number of 10 participants.
            </li>
            <li>
              Plan for pre-workshop activities: If applicable, share and distribute any pre-workshop
              materials (e.g., design kits) to participants in advance of the workshop.
            </li>
            <li>
              Distribute: Share accepted position papers or workshop artifacts. This will help
              participants to familiarize themselves with workshop content and encourage more
              in-depth discussions.
            </li>
            <li>
              Ensure the workshop organizers and participants are aware of the ACM Code of Ethics
              and Professional Conduct.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <h2>Registration for Workshops</h2>
          <p>
            Workshop Organizers: All organizers who plan to attend the workshop must register for
            the workshop by the ASSETS 2025 early registration deadline.
          </p>

          <p>
            Workshop Attendees: Must register for the workshop they are attending by th ASSETS 2025
            early registration deadline.
          </p>

          <p>
            Registration fee: Workshop registration fes will be found on the registration page –
            attendees do not need to register for the conference to attend the workshops.

            start and we have recently made a commitment to collect ORCID IDs from all of our
            published authors. We are committed to improving author discoverability, ensuring proper
            attribution and contributing to ongoing community efforts around name normalization;
            your ORCID ID will help in these efforts.
