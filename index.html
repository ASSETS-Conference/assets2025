The flags feature a design with a large red “C” filled with a golden disc against a blue and white striped background. The flags are strung across the street, creating a festive atmosphere. The buildings in the background are a mix of historic and modern architecture, showcasing brick facades alongside contemporary high-rises. Strings of lights add to the ambiance, hanging above the street and enhancing the urban aesthetic. The scene captures a vibrant and welcoming atmosphere, likely in an area popular for events or gatherings."

            The ASSETS conference is the premier forum for presenting research on the design,
            evaluation, use, and education related to computing for people with disabilities and
            older adults. For those in Europe and Oceania, ASSETS is rated as Core A —a designation
            for the top academic conferences that are "highly respected in a discipline area" (Core
            A; Top 16%).
          </p>

          <p>
            We invite high-quality original submissions on topics relevant to computing and
            accessibility. All contributions are peer-reviewed by an international Program
            Committee. Accepted papers and the abstracts for posters and demonstrations, experience
            reports, and the student research competition will be archived in the ACM Digital
            Library. Authors of selected papers will be invited to submit extended versions of their
            papers to a special issue of the ACM Transactions on Accessible Computing (TACCESS).
          </p>

          <p>
            *The in-person full conference events will take place from October 23 to October 25.
            However, invitation-only events (i.e. the Doctoral Consortium) will take place on
            October 22.
