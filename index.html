            The ASSETS conference is the premier forum for presenting research on the design,
            evaluation, use, and education related to computing for people with disabilities and
            older adults. For those in Europe and Oceania, ASSETS is rated as Core A —a designation
            for the top academic conferences that are "highly respected in a discipline area" (Core
            A; Top 16%).
          </p>

          <p>
            We invite high-quality original submissions on topics relevant to computing and
            accessibility. All contributions are peer-reviewed by an international Program
            Committee. Accepted papers and the abstracts for posters and demonstrations, experience
            reports, and the student research competition will be archived in the ACM Digital
            Library. Authors of selected papers will be invited to submit extended versions of their
            papers to a special issue of the ACM Transactions on Accessible Computing (TACCESS).
          </p>

          <p>
            *The in-person full conference events will take place from October 26 to October 29.
            However, invitation-only events (i.e. the Doctoral Consortium) will take place on
            October 25.
