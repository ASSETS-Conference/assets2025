            We invite high-quality original submissions on topics relevant to computing and

            Committee. Accepted papers and the abstracts for posters and demonstrations, experience
            reports, and the student research competition will be archived in the ACM Digital
            Library. Authors of selected papers will be invited to submit extended versions of their
            papers to a special issue of the ACM Transactions on Accessible Computing (TACCESS).
