            For insight on how mentoring might be helpful, read <a href="https://medium.com/@yasmineg/three-personal-accessibility-failure-stories-3554c9c5b2c0">this blog post</a> from our current mentoring chair, 
            Yasmine Elgaly, on her experiences in writing her early ASSETS papers.
          </p>
          <p>
            Mentoring is an important process that helps bring new researchers into the ASSETS
            community and to ensure that papers are accessible to everyone. Mentors can assist in
            paper writing and accessible submission information. This page provides information for
            Mentors and Mentees for ASSETS 2025 including expectations and applications.
          </p>

          <p>
            Mentorship: Help from seasoned researchers is available through the ASSETS Mentoring
            Program. You may receive advice on a submission in any of the submission categories
            provided by ASSETS. If you would benefit from mentoring because you are new to
            presenting your research, new to the category you would like to submit to, or seek
            assistance in preparing an accessible paper, please consider applying for mentoring
            help.
          </p>
          <p>Deadlines to request a mentor are:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Thursday, February 20, 2025 (Early Deadline)</li>
            <li>Wednesday, March 12, 2025 (Late Deadline)</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Applicants who submit by February 20 will be given <strong>priority</strong> in getting
            paired with a mentor. If you apply after the
            <strong>final deadline of Wednesday, March 12, 2025</strong>, we cannot guarantee that
            we will find a mentor for you. Additionally, mentors working with late applicants may
            have limited time to provide feedback due to the shorter timeline, which could result in
            only one quick revision or a single meeting to answer clarifying questions.
          </p>
          <p>
            While this can still be helpful, we strongly encourage you to apply by the
            <strong>early deadline of February 20</strong> to maximize the mentoring support
            available to you.

          <h2 id="whatIsMentoring">What is Mentoring?</h2>
          <p>
            Help from seasoned researchers is available through the ASSETS Mentoring Program. You
            may receive advice on a submission in any of the submission categories provided by
            ASSETS. If you think you would benefit from mentoring because you are new to presenting
            your research, new to the type of category you would like to submit to, or simply find
            preparing an English-language or accessible paper to be difficult, please consider
            applying for mentoring help.
          </p>

          <p>
            Mentoring typically pertains to the process of composing the submission, with one to two
            communication sessions. After reviews are received, mentees are encouraged to contact
            their mentor again and seek advice on interpreting the reviewers' comments. Even if the
            submission is accepted, this final session may help the mentee produce an even better
            camera-ready version.
          </p>

          <p>
            Mentors provide feedback to authors on a draft of their paper and particularly highlight
            how an ASSETS paper could differ from other conferences in expectations. Mentors are not
            co-authors on the paper, their role is to provide advice during the writing process.
            Mentoring is not a prerequisite for submitting a paper to ASSETS. It is meant to help
            bring in researchers to our community.
          </p>

          <h2>Mentoring for Accessible Submission</h2>
          <p>
            Mentors can also provide advice on creating more accessible papers for submission. It is
            important to the ASSETS community that the research we produce is accessible to everyone
            and at every stage of the publication process. However, producing accessible research
            articles, especially in PDF format, can be challenging. If you are new to this process,
            refer to the
            <a
              href="https://www.sigaccess.org/welcome-to-sigaccess/resources/accessible-pdf-author-guide/"
              target="_blank"
              >instructions on Creating Accessible PDFs</a
            >. If you are new to producing accessible documents or are looking for advice on how to
            make your research more accessible, please join our mentoring program. This is not a
            service to make your paper accessible for you, but accessibility mentors will help all
            authors get the advice and resources they need for the process.
          </p>

          <h2>Apply to have an ASSETS 2025 Mentor</h2>
          <p>
            To apply, please use the
            <a href="https://wwu.az1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_5b990LO4cstOSoe" target="_blank"
              >mentoring request form</a
            >
            to enter the following details so we can match you to a suitable mentor. You will need
            to submit a working title and an abstract summarizing your paper and its contribution.
          </p>

          <p>
            The early deadline to request a mentor is Thursday, February 20, 2025, and applicants
            meeting this deadline will have priority in being paired with a mentor. The final
            deadline is Wednesday, March 12, 2025, but mentor availability cannot be guaranteed for
            late applicants, and the mentoring support may be more limited due to time constraints.
          </p>

          <p>
            After we introduce you and your mentor via email, you will need to send your submission
            to that person and discuss it together, for example, by email or video call.
          </p>

          <h2 id="volunteer">Volunteer to be an ASSETS 2025 Mentor</h2>
          <p>
            Mentoring is an important process that helps bring new researchers into the ASSETS
            community. Potential mentors should have had at least one accepted paper at past ASSETS
            and be willing to spend the time as indicated above. If you are interested in being a
            mentor, please email the mentoring chairs (<a href="mailto:mentoring-assets25@acm.org"
              >mentoring-assets25@acm.org</a
            >) by Thursday , February 20, 2025, to indicate your area of expertise.
          </p>

          <h2>Suggested Communication Process</h2>
          <p>
            Once we have put the mentor and mentee in touch, they are free to design their mentoring
            experience in the way that best suits their needs, including choosing their preferred
            communication method. The following suggested steps are merely an example to guide the
            process and can be adapted or adjusted as the mentor and mentee see fit:
          </p>
          <ol>
            <li>
              Initial connection (late February/early March). The mentor and mentee discuss their
              preferred schedule for the process, communication norms, and plan.
            </li>
            <li>
              Early Connection (By early March): The mentee sends the paper draft by email to the
              mentor to give her/him/them a chance to read it in advance, either via a ‘shared’
              document platform (e.g. Google Docs, Overleaf) or as an attached file;
            </li>
            <li>
              Meeting 1 (By mid-March): The mentor and mentee set up an appointment for a video call
              by email. The pair discuss the document (e.g. Google Docs, Overleaf) focusing on the
              first part of the paper, such as the related work, methods, and findings. At the
              scheduled time, the mentor and mentee establish the video call, and open the shared
              file in a web browser. That way they can talk about the submission and simultaneously
              edit it, instantly seeing what the counterpart does – almost as good as meeting
              face-to-face!;
            </li>
            <li>
              Revision Period: The mentee revises their paper based on the mentor's feedback. The
              revised draft is submitted to the mentor within two weeks;
            </li>
            <li>
              Meeting 2 (By early April): The mentor and mentee schedule a second video call to
              discuss the updated draft. This meeting focuses on refining the paper's structure and
              addressing sections not covered during Meeting 1, such as the discussion and
              conclusion.
            </li>
            <li>
              Post-Review Support: After the paper is submitted, the mentee is encouraged to seek
              advice from their mentor on how to respond to reviewer comments or prepare a rebuttal.
            </li>
          </ol>

          <p>
            Participating in the ASSETS Mentoring Program does not guarantee that ASSETS will accept
            your submission. However, most individuals who have used the mentoring service at ASSETS
            or at the CHI conference where it began have reported positive experiences and an
            improved understanding of what reviewers require in general.
