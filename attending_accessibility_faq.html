            The Accessibility Chair for ASSETS 2025 is Abraham Glasser, Ather Sharif, Franklin
            Mingzhe Li, whose goal is to ensure the conference is accessible to everyone. When you
            register for the conference, there will be a registration question labeled "Do you have
            a disability or special need which requires our awareness?". In your response, please
            indicate any accessibility needs such as wheelchair access, sign language
            interpretation, or a guide. The Accessibility Chair will follow up with you to clarify
            your needs. You can contact them directly at any time by emailing
            <a href="mailto:access-assets25@acm.org" bis_skin_checked="1">access-assets25@acm.org</a

            will be available.

            The conference space at The Curtis Hotel in Denver is a vibrant and playful departure
            from typical corporate venues, designed to energize and inspire attendees. Spread across
            two dedicated floors, the more than 28,000 square feet of meeting space embraces a fun
            pop-culture theme, featuring large, modern ballrooms and uniquely named breakout rooms
            like "Thing-A-Ma-Jig" and "Who-Done-It." You can expect a dynamic atmosphere with bright
            colors, quirky decor, and spacious pre-function areas perfect for networking, all
            equipped with modern A/V technology. This stimulating and memorable environment makes
            any conference feel more like a creative and engaging event rather than a stuffy, formal
            gathering.
