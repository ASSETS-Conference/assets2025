          <h1>ASSETS 2025 Workshops</h1>

          <p>
            To host a workshop at ASSETS, workshop organizers submitted a proposal following the
            Workshop Proposal CFP in July, 2025. These proposals were then peer reviewed by two
            expert reviewers and selected by the Workshop Track Co-chairs, Annuska Zolyomi and
            Kotaro Hara (<a href="mailto:workshops-assets25@acm.org">workshops-assets25@acm.org</a
            >).
          </p>

          <p>
            Ultimately, five workshops, including one in-person workshop, were selected (listed
            below). To attend a workshop, please see the individual workshop webpages—each have
            their own CFPs and participation criteria.

            <h3>Abstract</h3>
            <p>
              Collaboration and community building are crucial for equitable participation in
              research, especially in disability and accessibility research fields. Engaging with
              communities of disabled individuals helps understand their unique challenges,
              expectations, and needs, which should be reflected in assistive technology design.
              However, a gap exists between research in resource-rich societies and the practices of
              low-resource settings, where socio-economic and infrastructural constraints are often
              overlooked. Conversely, the innovation and sustainable solutions in these settings are
              often not fully utilized globally. Our workshop will explore how collaboration and
              inclusive research practices can inform the development of affordable assistive
              technologies across borders, particularly in resource-limited contexts, aiming to
              leverage local expertise, fabrication tools, and global partnerships for sustainable
              solutions. By fostering global collaboration, community-driven research, and
              sustainable innovation, we aim to bridge the accessibility research gap and create
              scalable solutions that enhance the quality of life for people with disabilities
              worldwide.

            <h3>Abstract</h3>
            <p>
              Digital assistive technologies (ATs) have been widely used to support people with
              disabilities at work. However, many existing systems, interfaces, and tools remain
              inaccessible or insufficiently adaptable to the wide range of human abilities,
              particularly when cognitive, communicative, or sensory differences are involved. This
              gap is further exacerbated by what scholars and activists refer to as the disability
              divide: the sociotechnical disparity between people with and without disabilities in
              terms of access to, use of, and benefits from digital technologies. Despite increasing
              policy efforts and legal frameworks, vocational inclusion and training remains a
              significant challenge. By bringing together a diverse community, this workshop seeks
              to critically examine the role of digital ATs in advancing vocational inclusion for
              individuals with disabilities.

            <h3>Abstract</h3>
            <p>
              Intimacy is a complex, multifaceted subject of importance within disability rights
              movements. Disabled individuals are entitled to the same universal human rights (e.g.,
              marriage, sexual and reproductive self-determination) as everyone else. Assistive
              measures that support equity in their personal lives remain central to these
              movements. However, the research community’s relatively narrow focus of what
              "intimacy" is (i.e., primarily concerned with sex) combined with factors, such as
              context, cultural sensitivities, power dynamics and complex ethics, has resulted in
              its limited exploration in HCI Accessibility Research. Among the relatively small body
              of HCI literature, most works approach disabled intimacies through a primarily
              deficit-oriented and heteronormative lens. Notably, ASSETS has featured only two
              papers on this subject in the past 23 years. Moreover, few studies in HCI explore the
              methodological and ethical considerations of researching disabled intimacies, and even
              fewer are disability-led and include queer perspectives. In this half-day virtual
              workshop, we invite engineers, technology design and development researchers, industry
              practitioners, accessibility advocates, as well as anyone with disabled and/or queer
              lived experiences to discuss potential avenues to expand research in Disability
              Intimacy within HCI. Our goal is to better define what this novel research field could
              look like, facilitate connections between individuals interested in exploring it, and

            <h3>Abstract</h3>
            <p>
              Recruiting participants from disability communities for accessibility research
              presents unique challenges that require careful consideration of ethical practices,
              intersectional representation, methodological rigor, and community sustainability. As
              accessibility research continues to grow and evolve, researchers face tensions between
              meaningfully including participants with disabilities and addressing emerging concerns
              around recruited participants not adequately representing the diversity of the
              community, overburdening certain participants, participant verification, and fair
              compensation practices. This workshop will bring together members of the ASSETS
              community to examine current recruiting practices and document insights into ethical,
              rigorous, and inclusive participant recruitment in disability research. Through
              facilitated discussions, we will explore three main themes: (1) methods and models,
              (2) eligibility criteria and participant verification, and (3) ethical and
              sustainability considerations. The workshop aims to share current practices, identify
              key challenges, and develop preliminary guidelines to support accessibility
              researchers in more sustainable participant recruitment.

            <h3>Abstract</h3>
            <p>
              Teaching accessibility is an essential step towards supporting the integration of
              accessibility principles in software and other technologies, especially as ADA Title
              II regulations increase awareness around educational accessibility considerations.
              While existing literature captures the prevalence of accessibility in computing
              curriculums, understanding how accessibility can be taught across different
              disciplines is critical to effective accessibility education. This interdisciplinary
              workshop invites researchers and educators to discuss approaches to teaching
              accessibility in different disciplines, especially with respect to Title II
              compliance. Through sharing experiences and lessons learned, this workshop
              consolidates accessibility education methods while analyzing the role of teaching
              accessibility in developing accessible courses, classrooms, and technologies.
