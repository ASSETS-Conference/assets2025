          <h3>Abstract</h3>
          <p>Collaboration and community building are crucial for equitable participation in research, especially in disability and accessibility research fields. Engaging with communities of disabled individuals helps understand their unique challenges, expectations, and needs, which should be reflected in assistive technology design. However, a gap exists between research in resource-rich societies and the practices of low-resource settings, where socio-economic and infrastructural constraints are often overlooked. Conversely, the innovation and sustainable solutions in these settings are often not fully utilized globally. Our workshop will explore how collaboration and inclusive research practices can inform the development of affordable assistive technologies across borders, particularly in resource-limited contexts, aiming to leverage local expertise, fabrication tools, and global partnerships for sustainable solutions. By fostering global collaboration, community-driven research, and sustainable innovation, we aim to bridge the accessibility research gap and create scalable solutions that enhance the quality of life for people with disabilities worldwide.

          <h3>Abstract</h3>
        <p>Digital assistive technologies (ATs) have been widely used to support people with disabilities at work. However, many existing systems, interfaces, and tools remain inaccessible or insufficiently adaptable to the wide range of human abilities, particularly when cognitive, communicative, or sensory differences are involved. This gap is further exacerbated by what scholars and activists refer to as the disability divide: the sociotechnical disparity between people with and without disabilities in terms of access to, use of, and benefits from digital technologies. Despite increasing policy efforts and legal frameworks, vocational inclusion and training remains a significant challenge. By bringing together a diverse community, this workshop seeks to critically examine the role of digital ATs in advancing vocational inclusion for individuals with disabilities. </p>

<h3>Abstract</h3>
<p></p>Intimacy is a complex, multifaceted subject of importance within disability rights movements. Disabled individuals are entitled to the same universal human rights (e.g., marriage, sexual and reproductive self-determination) as everyone else. Assistive measures that support equity in their personal lives remain central to these movements. However, the research community’s relatively narrow focus of what "intimacy" is (i.e., primarily concerned with sex) combined with factors, such as context, cultural sensitivities, power dynamics and complex ethics, has resulted in its limited exploration in HCI Accessibility Research. Among the relatively small body of HCI literature, most works approach disabled intimacies through a primarily deficit-oriented and heteronormative lens. Notably, ASSETS has featured only two papers on this subject in the past 23 years [53]. Moreover, few studies in HCI explore the methodological and ethical considerations of researching disabled intimacies, and even fewer are disability-led and include queer perspectives [53]. In this half-day virtual workshop, we invite engineers, technology design and development researchers, industry practitioners, accessibility advocates, as well as anyone with disabled and/or queer lived experiences to discuss potential avenues to expand research in Disability Intimacy within HCI. Our goal is to better define what this novel research field could look like, facilitate connections between individuals interested in exploring it, and contribute to its overall visibility and expansion</p>

<h3>Abstract</h3>
<p>Recruiting participants from disability communities for accessibility research presents unique challenges that require careful consideration of ethical practices, intersectional representation, methodological rigor, and community sustainability. As accessibility research continues to grow and evolve, researchers face tensions between meaningfully including participants with disabilities and addressing emerging concerns around recruited participants not adequately representing the diversity of the community, overburdening certain participants, participant verification, and fair compensation practices. This workshop will bring together members of the ASSETS community to examine current recruiting practices and document insights into ethical, rigorous, and inclusive participant recruitment in disability research. Through facilitated discussions, we will explore three main themes: (1) methods and models, (2) eligibility criteria and participant verification, and (3) ethical and sustainability considerations. The workshop aims to share current practices, identify key challenges, and develop preliminary guidelines to support accessibility researchers in more sustainable participant recruitment.</p>

<h3>Abstract</h3>
<p>Teaching accessibility is an essential step towards supporting the integration of accessibility principles in software and other technologies, especially as ADA Title II regulations increase awareness around educational accessibility considerations. While existing literature captures the prevalence of accessibility in computing curriculums, understanding how accessibility can be taught across different disciplines is critical to effective accessibility education. This interdisciplinary workshop invites researchers and educators to discuss approaches to teaching accessibility in different disciplines, especially with respect to Title II compliance. Through sharing experiences and lessons learned, this workshop consolidates accessibility education methods while analyzing the role of teaching accessibility in developing accessible courses, classrooms, and technologies.</p>
